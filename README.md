# GDownloader

A simple CLI tool for downloading content from the streaming platform [hianime.dk](https://hianime.dk) + [social media platfroms](#supported-platforms). \
This is a working fork of [gheatherington/HianimeDownloader](https://github.com/gheatherington/HianimeDownloader) for **hianime.dk** (hianime.to is dead).

## What's fixed in this fork

- Domain updated to `hianime.dk` — search, episode list and server selection now use the site's JSON API
  (`/api/theme/episode/list/{id}`, `/api/theme/episode/servers?episodeId=`), so the browser is only opened on
  the player embed page to capture the stream (far fewer ad redirects).
- Episode list no longer relies on server-rendered `a[data-number]` (removed on the new site); anime id is
  resolved from the URL slug as a fallback.
- Fixed m3u8 capture: no more `jwpltx ping.gif` false positives, and m3u8 is also parsed from the
  `getSources` JSON when needed.
- Fixed `yt-dlp "Did not get any data blocks"` by stripping selenium-wire headers down to
  User-Agent / Referer / Cookie.
- Added rate-limit (HTTP 429) handling: throttled fragment downloads, more retries, and `--aria` support
  (aria2c) for the `cdn.kryntal.top` CDN.
- Dropped the `langdetect` dependency.

## Requirements

- Python3 + PIP3
- Chrome Installed

## Setup

1. Download the files from the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/natale327/HianimeDownloader
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory it was downloaded to in your terminal.
3. Using pip install all the requirement from the `requirements.txt` file.
   - For Windows

     ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - For Linux/macOS you may have to first create a virtual environment, so use the following commands.

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. You are now ready to run the program with the following command.
   - Windows

     ```bash
      python main.py
     ```

   - Linux/MacOS

     ```bash
      python3 main.py
     ```

## Usage

- Update the repository before running (as it is still being worked on)

  ```bash
  git fetch https://github.com/gheatherington/HianimeDownloader
  ```

- After running the `main.py` file, enter the name of the anime you would like to search for
  from [hianime.dk](https://hianime.dk) or provide a link to the content you would like to download

- If you provided a link you will jump to either the [Downloading from HiAnime](#downloading-from-hianime) or [Downloading from Other](#downloading-from-other-platforms)
- If you enter a name of an anime it will bring up a selection of anime options from the site, select the desired one with the corresponding number.

### Downloading From HiAnime

- Next you will be prompted to either select which version of the anime you would like; either sub or dub. If only one
  was available, it will be automatically selected for you.
- The next two prompts ask which episodes you want to download. You first provide the first episode, then the last
  episode you would like to download (both values are inclusive)
- The next prompt asks what season in the series this content is as an integer.
- The final prompt asks you which of the streaming servers you would like to download from (HD-1, HD-2, etc.)
- **Note** if a redirect ad to a second tab is created, close the second tab manually and refresh the original site to
  continue download. (This will hopefully be patched eventually)

### Downloading from other platforms

- Depending on the platform ([view list of supported platforms](#supported-platforms)) you will either be prompted to select a file name or it will be automatically chosen for you

## Options

You are able to pass parameters when running the file to add additional options.

- `-o` or `--output-dir` lets you provide a path for the output files. For example,

  ```bash
  python3 main.py -o ~/Movies/
  ```

- `-l` or `--link` allows you to pass in a link to the content you want to download

- `-n` or `--filename` allows you to pass in the name of the anime you are looking for, or the filename for the downloaded content from [other platforms](#supported-platforms)

- `--no-subtitles` downloads the content without looking for subtitle files

- `--server` allows you to select the streaming server you would like to downlaod from.

- `--aria` uses the aria2c downloader for yt-dlp to download the content (untested)

### Usage Example

```bash
python3 main.py -o ~/Desktop/ --server "HD-1" -n "Solo Leveling" --no-subtitles

```
